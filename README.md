<h2>How to train a deep learning model in PyTorch and fast.ai with GPU support with 3 lines of code</h2>

This repository shows how to submit a training job to Azure Machine Learning Services to train a deep learning model using PyTorch and fast.asi. I solved the popular dogs vs cats Kaggle classification problem. You can read the full story at Medium. The idea is to show how Azure Machine Learning works since documentation seem to be a bit fussy right now. Will improve soon.
